-step1: Install mysql-server
+ step 1.1: Update new password for root user OR 
CMD: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY [new_user_password];
Config add new user with full permission
To configure full permissions for a new user in MySQL server on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

1. **Connect to MySQL**²:
    ```
    sudo mysql -u root -p
    ```
    If you have already set the root user password then the above command will prompt the password. After connecting to MySQL, you will be inside the MySQL command line².

2. **Create a new user with a password**¹²:
    ```
    CREATE USER 'new_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_user_password';
    ```
    Replace `'new_user'` with the actual user and `'new_user_password'` with the password that you want to set². This command will create a new user with the specified password¹².

3. **Grant all privileges to the new user**¹⁵:
    ```
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'new_user'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
    This command will grant all privileges to the new user¹⁵. Remember to replace `'new_user'` with your actual username¹⁵.

Please note that these operations will change your MySQL configuration, so make sure you understand them and replace `'new_user'` and `'new_user_password'` with your actual username and password.
