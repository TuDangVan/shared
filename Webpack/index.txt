- What?
+ Webpack is static module, it used to compile javascript module.
+ It used to build source js/ts/jsx/tsx to js file (It included files already optimized.) (It will have many mode dev or production)
+ In an some framework like: nextjs, nestjs, it already support about build & optimized source. But with some project specify we need 
build an manually source we can use webpack to process this issue.

- How?
+ We can interact with webpack from cli or api

++ Solution 1: Use cli
++++ 
For configured, webpack can config easy at webpack.config.js file
At webpack config 
++ Solution 2: Use Api

- Benefit?  
+ Like discuss at first of document. Moreover webpack can dynamioc bundle module or graph dependences related, 
it will help avoid bundle module unused
+ An feature of webpack, we can use it to bundle for any type of files, besides javascript files, for example: css, images/*, ... 

Why?
- Why call webpack is static module bundler?
+ Webpack can call is an static module bundle when it used to bundle static file likes: image, css, html, or another code static...
+ Answer: Because when build webpack in javascript app, It will build all dependences as a static module js
+ Webpack will start run from CMD, or modules which config at webpack.config file, after it will auto internally build 
an static js module files where will includes all dependences required in modules (in webpack config file). And this file will 
bundle to client

+ Beside webpack can call is an dynamic bundle, when It can bundle dynamic module if need

Question?
Why need use webpack? 
- Webpack will help we compile all extension (.ts, .tsx, .jsx....) to javascript code file

what advantage of it?
- Like this concept, webpack will help we build source to standard javascript language.
- It can optimized when we excute build process, It will help for production enviroment can work stable.
- It also help we bundle assets file like: css, images (jpg, png, ...)
what defect of it?
