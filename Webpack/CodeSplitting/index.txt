- What?
Code splitting is one feture of webpack. It used to split code 
into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or 
parallel.

Normal understand: The same with code, with build code, we also want split to 
many build files and we can control resource load prioritization

- How?
There are three general approaches to code splitting available:

+ Entry Points:
- What?
It is a approaches which we mus manually split code useing entry configuration
* Downside:
- If three are any duplicated modules between entry chunks, they still will be included in 
both bundles
- It isn't as flexible and can't be used to dynamically split code with the core application logic.
- How?

+ Prevent Duplication:
- What?
*** Entry dependencies
+ The dependOn Option allows to share the modules between the chucks.

*** SplitChunksPlugin
+ The SplitChunksPlugin allows us to extract common dependencies into an existing entry

+ Dynamic Imports: (Should use this solution for Production)
-  What?
This is aproache to can import async module in js

**** Prefetching / Preloading modules
- Prefetch: Tài nguyên là có thể cần cho một vài điều hướng trong tương lai
- Preload: Tài nguyên cũng sẽ cần trong điều hướng hiện Tại

**** Compare diference between preload and Prefetch
- About chuck: 
+ Preload chuck loading in parallel to the parent chuck.
+ Prefetched chuck start after the parent chuck loading finish

- About priority:
+ Preload chuck has medium priority and is instanly downloaded (Tải ngay lập tức)
+ Prefetch chuck is downloaded while the browser is idle.

- Time chuck: (Thời điểm chuck)
+ Preload chuck should be instantly requested by the parent chuck.
+ Prefetch chuck can be used anytime in the future.
