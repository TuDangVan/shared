What?
--- It's an custom api 
--- It can also handle fetch from server, or redirect user when an page access, and has middleware to check & redirect user

How?
--- We need create an route file inside app folder,
--- We can ozanigation api route with two solutions:
++++ solution 1:
 Define direct route.tsx inside segment folder
++++ Solution 2:
 Define an api folder where has route.tsx file 
**** Recommend should use solution 1, because solution 2 should only use for define common api
For example:
    app
        - api
            - route.tsx
