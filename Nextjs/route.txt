1) Nextjs help we can build an web front-end with orangization carefull:
+ Route -> Map Page.tsx
+ Route Structure:
    (Base component: .(tsx | js | jsx))
    - Global-Error
    - Layout 
    - Template
    - Error
    - Loading
    - Page
        - Global-Error
        - Layout
        - Template
        - Error
        - Loading
        - Page
            - Global-Error
            - Layout
            - Template
            - Error
            - Loading
            - Page
*** Remember:
- With folder Structure nextjs auto wrapper app with common layout component
For example: Error.js component will auto Create an ErrorBound for Segment or nested child in this segment

- To catche an path of route: We need use 
+ For example we need check an page is activing we can use usePathname() -> to get path name on browser
E.x: const pathname = usePathname();

- To scroll to an element on nextjs:
+ Idea it will use base solution of an normal website, We need only use # after address path
 (With this id must map with id of an component already exist in DOM)
For example: <a href="/dashboard#setting">Dashboard</a> -> browser will auto scroll to element has id=setting
