- Beside use folder structure as a segment for define route structure, we can use format folder to define 
an group router:
For example: 
- root
    - (marketing)
        - layout.tsx
        - about
            - page.tsx
    - (checkout)
        - layout.tsx
        - about
            - page.tsx
    - (cart)
        - layout.tsx
-> It will useful when we has an dynamic design for each page, will use layout map with this page, because it is will skip group name.
