- Nextjs allow parallel route, this mean on a page can use many route to render at the same time
+ How?
---> We only define folder with format: @[folder] 
For example:
    @analytic
        - error.tsx
        - loading.tsx
        - page.tsx
    @team
        - error.tsx
        - loading.tsx
        - page.tsx
--> This meam, we can understand parallel route allow we stream data for each page, error component and Loading component
is diference
