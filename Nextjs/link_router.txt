- Has two solutions to redirect page:
+ Use <Link>: It provider by next
 ++ It is extends from <a> tag html, Used in client component sites to redirect between pages
 ++ It also provider prefetch data
 ++ And It is the primary way to redirect between pages on nextjs

+ Use useRouter(): It used to redirect on client component site

- How to Router work on server and client site with nextjs?

+ On server side:
 ++ Route will auto decode and build to path from route folder Structure 
+ On Client side:
 ++ Nextjs will prefetch data and catche route segment (On client side nextjs will cache all route segment)
 ---> This mean when use acess to new route, the browser will not reload the page
So what prefetch?
 - <Link>: <Link> component Already we discuss above, on clien site when users visit to web-site in the first time, 
    nextjs client will caches all route segment, It will auto prefetch page baseon route before user visit it.
 - We have two options for define route: 
  + Static route: prefetch default is true. The entire route is prefetched and cached
  + Dynamic route: prefetch is automatic. <Read Later>
