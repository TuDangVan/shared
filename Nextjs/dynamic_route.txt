For example:
/posts/[slug]
- And all dynamic router value is pass to param props in react:
For example:
const render_post = ({params}:{params: {slug: string}}) => {
    return <>{params.slug}</>
}

- Use Generating Static Params:
What Generating Statis Params: Its mean when an segment with dynnamic pages, we will fetch static page, and use
cache to memory and build it, with this way it will help reduce performce of build time. It is the same idea page will 
fetched from server side and it will auto cached, That mean with multi request same an param Layout and Pages will
auto reused.
